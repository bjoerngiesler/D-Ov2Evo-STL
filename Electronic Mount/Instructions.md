### Material, Orientation, Printing Tips

Print out of PETG, ABS, ASA, PLA+ or PLA, in order of preference. The slight flexibility of PETG helps here because it allows you to bend the whole thing a bit when the dovetail joint is opened, which can be helpful when routing cables. Prints face down with the legs sticking up.

### Preparation

If you like to tap your plastic for your screws, tap the following:
- 2 holes in the legs
- 4 holes on the side of the legs, where the amplifier mounts
- 4 holes on the top, where the mainboard mounts.

### Assembly

- Use 2 M3 countersunk screws to add the PCB Base to the Top Frame. Length doesn't really matter here, M3x8 or longer will be fine.
- Mount the Top Frame to the Bottom Frame (the one with the lead counterweight) using 6 M3x8 countersunk screws.
- Screw the mainboard onto the PCB Base using 4 M3 socket head screws, can be as short as 4mm or as long as 8mm.
- Screw the amplifier to the side of the PCB Base using 4 M3 socket head screws, can be as short as 4mm or as long as 8mm.
