# D-Ov2Evo Lazy Susans Instructions

This contains only `Drive Edge For Flex Tire Countersunk.stl`, an optional part that replaces the original `DriveEdge.stl` in the `Optional Flex Drivetyres` directory. It is only slightly modified to allow for more room for the countersunk screws that hold the small bearings in. I found these stood out a bit too far and sometimes rubbed against the body.

Apart from this one, the original Lazy Susans are unmodified. We heavily recommend the flex tyre variant!
