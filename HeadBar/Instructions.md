# D-Ov2Evo HeadBar Instructions

## Modified Files

Use these modified files:

```
HeadFrame Dynamixel.stl
ServoCouple Dynamixel.stl
```


## Original Files

Use these files from MrBaddeley's original D-Ov2 OneDrive:

```
TopBar.stl
Barskin.stl
HeadBar.stl
```

**Note** We use a carbon tube (OD 15mm, ID 13mm, 1mm wall thickness) cut to 124mm length instead of the printed Barskin. It's lighter and very slightly more rigid. It's also a good idea to superglue the skin onto the bar after all the cabling has been done, again for extra rigidity.

## Build Notes

Please check [the Wiki](https://github.com/bjoerngiesler/BBDroids/wiki/91-Individual-Droid:-D%E2%80%90O) for wiring. 

### Orientation and Supports

Use your printer's auto-orient feature.

### Material

ASA or PLA+ for everything. If you don't use a carbon tube but go with the standard printed Barskin, the main bar should definitely not be printed in PETG, it's too flexible and will wobble.
